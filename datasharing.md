## How to share data with a statistician
### This is a guide for anyone who needs to share data with a statistician or data scientist. The target audiences I have in mind are:
* Collaborators who need statisticians or data scientists to analyze data for them
* Students or postdocs in various disciplines looking for consulting advice
* Junior statistics students whose job it is to collate/clean/wrangle data sets
